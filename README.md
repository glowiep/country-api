# üåé United States Country API
A simple United States Country API made with Express and Prisma, providing information on states and cities.

![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-%23007ACC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)


This API is structured around three main entities: 
- states
- cities
- relationship between them (represented in the cities_states table)

## Goals üèÜ
- Building a simple country API to demonstrate knowledge on:
  - <b>Data Access and Management</b>
    - Set up and organize the backend effectively.
    - Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing state and city data.
  - <b> Integration and Scalability</b> 
    - Use TypeScript with Prisma to allow for seamless integration with Express JS.
  - <b>Documentation and Developer Experience</b> 
    - Apply the principles of ORM in practice and document what I have learned through the process of developing an API from scratch.

## What I learned üìö

### üé® Deep Dive into Prisma 
Prisma is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool designed to simplify database interactions and data modeling in modern web development.
- Abstraction of Database Operations
  - Prisma abstracts away low-level SQL queries and database interactions.
- Model-Driven Approach
  - Prisma encourages a model-driven approach to data management, where database entities (tables) are represented as models in the code. 
- Database Agnostic Approach
  - Prisma is great as it supports multiple database systems, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and SQL Server - allowing developers to switch between databases without significant code changes.
- Code Generation and Type Safety
  - Prisma's code generation capabilities create TypeScript/JavaScript client libraries based on the database schema, providing type safety and auto-completion in the IDE.
- Prisma Studio (favorite discovery ‚ô•)
  - I discovered Prisma Studio which provides a visual representation of your database schema, including tables, columns, relationships, and constraints. 
  - This makes it easy to explore and understand the structure of your database without writing SQL queries or accessing the database directly.


### üîç Discovering TypeScript
I gained hands-on experience integrating TypeScript with Prisma for database operations. 
- Static Typing
  - I learned how TypeScript can help catch errors during development time rather than runtime. This enhances code reliability, reduces bugs, and improves overall code quality.
- Improved Code Readability
  - I learned how to use TypeScript interfaces and types for defining API payloads. 

### üìà Overall Growth:
This project increased my understanding in understanding ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) concepts, including object-relational mapping, entity relationships, data abstraction, query generation, and data validation. This helped me gain valuable insights into modern JavaScript development practices, type systems, and tooling.

## Future Enhancements ‚ú®
Authentication and Security:
- Secure API endpoints with authentication mechanisms such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to control access.

## Running the Project üèÉ
1. Fork and clone this repo locally, then navigate to the root folder of the project.
2. Install dependencies by running:
```
npm install
```
3. Start postgresql. To create the country_api database, run the following in the terminal: 
```
createdb movie_api -O <enter your db owner name>
``` 
4. Start the express server:
```
npm run dev
```
5. To reset seed data: 
```
npx prisma migrate reset
```
6. Then rerun seed files: 
```
npm run seeds
```
7. Open prisma studio to view the tables (it will run on http://localhost:5555/):
```
npx prisma studio
```
